# NestJS CQRS Project

This repository contains a sample implementation of the CQRS pattern using NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. This project is designed as a reference to help developers understand and implement the CQRS pattern in their NestJS applications.

## About CQRS

CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation, a pattern that separates the read and update operations for a data store. Implementing CQRS can maximize performance, scalability, and security. The pattern allows you to scale read and write operations independently and ensures that complex domain designs do not hinder the client-facing experience.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm (or Yarn)
- Docker (for running database containers, if applicable)

## Installation

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dipeshkumarsah98/Nest-CQRS
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Nest-CQRS
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Set up your environment variables by copying the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` and adjusting the values as needed.

5. Start the application:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

## Project Structure

This project follows a modular structure, organizing the application into modules that represent different domains or features of the application. Each module may contain commands, queries, and event handlers, following the CQRS pattern.

- **src/**
  - **modules/**: Contains the application modules, each implementing a specific feature set.
  - **app.module.ts**: The root module of the application.
- **test/**: Contains unit and e2e tests for the application.
